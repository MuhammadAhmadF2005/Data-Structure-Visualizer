# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a simple web application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to visualize and interact with fundamental data structures including Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Trees. The application will provide a straightforward interface for users to perform basic operations on these data structures and see the results visually, helping them understand how these structures work through simple static visualizations that can be enhanced later.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student learning data structures, I want to visualize arrays with their elements and indices, so that I can understand how array operations work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Array page THEN the system SHALL display an array with sample elements showing indices and values
2. WHEN a user clicks "Add Element" THEN the system SHALL add a new element to the end of the array and update the display
3. WHEN a user clicks "Remove Element" THEN the system SHALL remove the last element from the array and update the display
4. WHEN a user enters an index to access THEN the system SHALL highlight that element and show its value
5. WHEN the array reaches maximum display capacity THEN the system SHALL show a message about array limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a computer science student, I want to visualize stack operations (push, pop, peek), so that I can understand the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Stack page THEN the system SHALL display a vertical stack with sample elements
2. WHEN a user clicks "Push" and enters a value THEN the system SHALL add the element to the top of the stack display
3. WHEN a user clicks "Pop" THEN the system SHALL remove the top element and show its value in a message
4. WHEN a user clicks "Peek" THEN the system SHALL highlight the top element and show its value
5. WHEN the stack is empty and user tries to pop THEN the system SHALL display "Stack is empty" message
6. WHEN the stack reaches display limit THEN the system SHALL show "Stack is full" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a programming student, I want to visualize queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, front, rear), so that I can understand the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Queue page THEN the system SHALL display a horizontal queue with sample elements and front/rear labels
2. WHEN a user clicks "Enqueue" and enters a value THEN the system SHALL add the element to the rear of the queue display
3. WHEN a user clicks "Dequeue" THEN the system SHALL remove the front element and show its value in a message
4. WHEN a user clicks "Front" THEN the system SHALL highlight the front element and show its value
5. WHEN the queue is empty and user tries to dequeue THEN the system SHALL display "Queue is empty" message
6. WHEN the queue reaches display limit THEN the system SHALL show "Queue is full" message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data structures learner, I want to visualize linked list operations (insert, delete, traverse), so that I can understand pointer-based data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Linked List page THEN the system SHALL display nodes connected by arrows with sample data
2. WHEN a user clicks "Insert at Head" THEN the system SHALL add a new node at the beginning and update the display
3. WHEN a user clicks "Delete Node" THEN the system SHALL remove the specified node and update connections
4. WHEN a user clicks "Traverse" THEN the system SHALL highlight each node in sequence and show the traversal path
5. WHEN the list is empty THEN the system SHALL display "NULL" or "Empty List"
6. WHEN a user tries to delete from an empty list THEN the system SHALL display "List is empty" message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a computer science student, I want to visualize binary tree traversals, so that I can understand how preorder, inorder, and postorder work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Tree page THEN the system SHALL display a sample binary tree with nodes and connecting lines
2. WHEN a user clicks "Preorder Traversal" THEN the system SHALL highlight nodes in preorder sequence and show the result
3. WHEN a user clicks "Inorder Traversal" THEN the system SHALL highlight nodes in inorder sequence and show the result
4. WHEN a user clicks "Postorder Traversal" THEN the system SHALL highlight nodes in postorder sequence and show the result
5. WHEN traversal is complete THEN the system SHALL display the complete traversal sequence
6. WHEN a user clicks "Reset" THEN the system SHALL clear all highlights and results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple navigation system to switch between different data structure visualizations, so that I can easily explore all the available structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a main index page with links to all visualizers
2. WHEN a user clicks on a data structure link THEN the system SHALL navigate to that specific visualizer page
3. WHEN a user is on a visualizer page THEN the system SHALL provide a "Back to Menu" link
4. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-friendly navigation
5. WHEN a user wants to switch between visualizers THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation options
